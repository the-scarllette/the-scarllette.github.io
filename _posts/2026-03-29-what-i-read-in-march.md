Aliens, board games in python, and sci-fi roleplaying. These are the games, papers, and books I read in March 2025.

## Book: Birdking Volume 3
Birdking is an ongoing sword and sorcery comic book about war, friendship, and giant magical undead knights. Like all fantasy work, it sits in the show of The Lord of the Rings, but it feels much more in direct conversation with this past than other recent works.

Birdking is able to tell the story of people caught in war. Not a war where 'both sides are wrong', but one where the people caught in between rarely want to be fighting. 

The series is ongoing, with a new volume releasing roughly once a year. Go check it out if you like fantasy, amazing fights, and feeling really really sad.

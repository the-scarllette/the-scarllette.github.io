## Installation

1. Follow the steps to [create repository from template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

## Usage

### Basic Setup
1. Set any social links you would like to include in `_data/social_links.yml`. You can add as many as you like!
2. News posts are formatted like this:
```
{: .news-header}
[Month, Year]

{: .news}
Text for your news here
```
Additional news posts can be added in the `news-archive.md` file with the same format.    

3. Fun facts can be added in `_data/facts.yml`. The theme will automatically turn this into a linked list for you.   
4. If you would like to add/remove sections from the home page, `_data/navigation.yml` has each page and the link. 
For the links that go to a header on the homepage you can use the name of the header after the home page route: 

*file: index.md*
```markdown
# Section
```
would be   
*file: navigation.yml*
``` yaml
- name: Section
  link: /#section
```
See this [markdown reference](https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#headers) for more guidance on how to figure out the links for your headers.

For links that go to other pages on the site you will most likely have to prefix the page name with `../../`. 
```yaml
- name: Writing
  link: ../../writing.html
```
 

### Writing Posts

Create posts in `_posts` directory following this format:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: Your Post Title
description: Brief description
tags: [tag1, tag2]
toc: true # Optional table of contents
---
Your content here...
```

Make sure to name the file with the `YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md`. 


### Customization

#### Color Skins

The theme comes with several preset color schemes. You can set the base skin in the `config.yaml` file and the light and dark mode will automatically adapt to whatever the user has set as their preference. 

### Light Mode Variants
| Theme | Preview |
|-------|---------|
| Purple | ![Purple Theme](assets/themes/purple.png) |

| GitHub | ![GitHub Theme](assets/themes/github.png) |
| Dracula | ![Dracula Theme](assets/themes/dracula.png) |
| Nord | ![Nord Theme](assets/themes/nord.png) |
| Monokai | ![Monokai Theme](assets/themes/monokai.png) |

#### Typography

This theme uses Nitti as its default font. You can purchase Nitti from [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/nitti). If you have purchased the font, you can put it in the `assets/fonts` directory and it should automatically load. 

If you want to use a different font, you will have to change lines 8-35 in `_sass/jekyll-theme-manpage.scss` to import/load the correct font. You will also need to set the default font in `_sass/variables.scss`

```css
// Typography
$font-family-mono: "Nitti", "Source Code Pro", "Inconsolata", monospace;
```

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Visit `http://localhost:4000`

If you want to try out the different skins, you will have to stop and start the bundler each time.

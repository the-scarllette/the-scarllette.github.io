      "content": "Markdown Syntax Guide\n\nHereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of markdown formatting options available in your posts.\n\n\n\nText Formatting\n\nBold text is created with double asterisks\nItalic text uses single asterisks\nStrikethrough uses double tildes\n\nLists\n\nUnordered list:\n\n  Item 1\n  Item 2\n    \n      Nested item\n      Another nested item\n    \n  \n  Item 3\n\n\nOrdered list:\n\n  First item\n  Second item\n    \n      Nested numbered item\n      Another nested item\n    \n  \n  Third item\n\n\nCode Blocks\n\nInline code: const greeting = \"Hello World\"\n\nCode block with syntax highlighting:\nfunction calculateSum({ a, b }: { a: number, b: number }): number {\n    return a + b\n}\n\n\nBlockquotes\n\n\n  This is a blockquote\nIt can span multiple lines\n  \n    And can be nested\n  \n\n\nTables\n\n\n  \n    \n      Header 1\n      Header 2\n      Header 3\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Cell 1\n      Cell 2\n      Cell 3\n    \n    \n      Cell 4\n      Cell 5\n      Cell 6\n    \n  \n\n\nLinks and Images\n\nLink to external site\n\n\n\nTask Lists\n\n\n  Completed task\n  Incomplete task\n  Another completed task\n\n\nExtended Syntax\n\nDefinition Lists\n\nSome Markdown processors allow you to create definition lists of terms and their corresponding definitions. To create a definition list, type the term on the first line. On the next line, type a colon followed by a space and the definition.\n\nFirst Term\n: This is the definition of the first term.\n\nSecond Term\n: This is one definition of the second term.\n: This is another definition of the second term.\n\n\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\n&lt;dl&gt;\n  &lt;dt&gt;First Term&lt;/dt&gt;\n  &lt;dd&gt;This is the definition of the first term.&lt;/dd&gt;\n  &lt;dt&gt;Second Term&lt;/dt&gt;\n  &lt;dd&gt;This is one definition of the second term. &lt;/dd&gt;\n  &lt;dd&gt;This is another definition of the second term.&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;/dl&gt;\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  First Term\n  This is the definition of the first term.\n  Second Term\n  This is one definition of the second term.\n  This is another definition of the second term.\n\n\nEmoji\n\nThere are two ways to add emoji to Markdown files: copy and paste the emoji into your Markdown-formatted text, or type emoji shortcodes.\n\nCopying and Pasting Emoji\n\nIn most cases, you can simply copy an emoji from a source like Emojipedia and paste it into your document. Many Markdown applications will automatically display the emoji in the Markdown-formatted text. The HTML and PDF files you export from your Markdown application should display the emoji.\n\n\n   Tip: If you're using a static site generator, make sure you encode HTML pages as UTF-8.\n\n\nUsing Emoji Shortcodes\n\nSome Markdown applications allow you to insert emoji by typing emoji shortcodes. These begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji.\n\nGone camping! :tent: Be back soon.\n\nThat is so funny! :joy:\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nGone camping! â›º Be back soon.\n\nThat is so funny! ðŸ˜‚\n\n\n   Note: You can use this list of emoji shortcodes, but keep in mind that emoji shortcodes vary from application to application. Refer to your Markdown application's documentation for more information.\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nFootnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\n\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets ([^1]). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they canâ€™t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself â€” in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\n\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You donâ€™t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\n\nHere's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]\n\n[^1]: This is the first footnote.\n\n[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.\n\n    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.\n\n    `{ my code }`\n\n    Add as many paragraphs as you like.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nHereâ€™s a simple footnote,1 and hereâ€™s a longer one.2\n\nHeading IDs\n\nMany Markdown processors support custom IDs for headings â€” some Markdown processors automatically add them. Adding custom IDs allows you to link directly to headings and modify them with CSS. To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading.\n\n### My Great Heading {#custom-id}\n\n\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\n&lt;h3 id=\"custom-id\"&gt;My Great Heading&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n\nLinking to Heading IDs\n\nYou can link to headings with custom IDs in the file by creating a standard link with a number sign (#) followed by the custom heading ID. These are commonly referred to as anchor links.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Markdown\n      HTML\n      Rendered Output\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      [Heading IDs](#heading-ids)\n       &lt;a href=\"#heading-ids\"&gt;Heading IDs&lt;/a&gt;\n      Heading IDs\n    \n  \n\n\nOther websites can link to the heading by adding the custom heading ID to the full URL of the webpage (e.g, [Heading IDs](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax#heading-ids)).\n\nHighlights\n\nThis isnâ€™t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to highlight text. The result looks like this. To highlight words, use two equal signs (==) before and after the words.\n\nI need to highlight these ==very important words==.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nI need to highlight these very important words.\n\nAlternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the mark HTML tag.\n\nI need to highlight these &lt;mark&gt;very important words&lt;/mark&gt;.\n\n\nStrikethrough\n\nYou can strikethrough words by putting a horizontal line through the center of them. The result looks like this. This feature allows you to indicate that certain words are a mistake not meant for inclusion in the document. To strikethrough words, use two tilde symbols (~~) before and after the words.\n\n~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nThe world is flat. We now know that the world is round.\n\nSubscript\n\nThis isnâ€™t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to use subscript to position one or more characters slightly below the normal line of type. To create a subscript, use one tilde symbol (~) before and after the characters.\n\nH~2~O\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nH2O\n\n\n   Tip: Be sure to test this in your Markdown application before using it. Some Markdown applications use one tilde symbol before and after words not for subscript, but for strikethrough. \n\n\nAlternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the sub HTML tag.\n\nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O\n\n\nSuperscript\n\nThis isnâ€™t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to use superscript to position one or more characters slightly above the normal line of type. To create a superscript, use one caret symbol (^) before and after the characters.\n\nX^2^\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nX2\n\nAlternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the sup HTML tag.\n\nX&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\n\n\nTables\n\nTo add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.\n\n| Syntax      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Header      | Title       |\n| Paragraph   | Text        |\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syntax\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Header\n      Title\n    \n    \n      Paragraph\n      Text\n    \n  \n\n\nCell widths can vary, as shown below. The rendered output will look the same.\n\n| Syntax | Description |\n| --- | ----------- |\n| Header | Title |\n| Paragraph | Text |\n\n\n\n   Tip: Creating tables with hyphens and pipes can be tedious. To speed up the process, try using the Markdown Tables Generator or AnyWayData Markdown Export. Build a table using the graphical interface, and then copy the generated Markdown-formatted text into your file.\n\n\nAlignment\n\nYou can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.\n\n| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |\n| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |\n| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |\n| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syntax\n      Description\n      Test Text\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Header\n      Title\n      Hereâ€™s this\n    \n    \n      Paragraph\n      Text\n      And more\n    \n  \n\n\nFormatting Text in Tables\n\nYou can format the text within tables. For example, you can add links, code (words or phrases in backticks (`) only, not code blocks), and emphasis.\n\nYou canâ€™t use headings, blockquotes, lists, horizontal rules, images, or most HTML tags.\n\n\n   Tip: You can use HTML to create line breaks and add lists within table cells.\n\n\nEscaping Pipe Characters in Tables\n\nYou can display a pipe (|) character in a table by using its HTML character code (&amp;#124;).\n\nCredits: https://www.markdownguide.org/\n\n  \n    \n      This is the first footnote.Â &#8617;\n    \n    \n      Hereâ€™s one with multiple paragraphs and code.\n\n      Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.\n\n      { my code }\n\n      Add as many paragraphs as you like.Â &#8617;\n    \n  \n\n",
